"""
A shortest-path forwarding application.
This is a standalone L2 switch that learns ethernet addresses
across the entire network and picks short paths between them.
You shouldn't really write an application this way -- you should
keep more state in the controller (that is, your flow tables),
and/or you should make your topology more static. However, this
does (mostly) work. :)
Depends on openflow.discovery
Works with openflow.spanning_tree
